**Q:** What does the Wave Function Collapse algorithm have to do with this library?

**A:** The core generation algorithm is called Wave Function collapse. DeBroglie provides a nice wrapper around this algorithm for providing a variety of effects.

**Q:** What does the Wave Function Collapse algorithm have to do with the quantum physics concept of [Wave Function Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)

**A:** Very little really. The original idea was that you have a probability space of possible tile choices similar to how a wave function is a possibility space for particle properties. 
But the comparison is only really skin deep - it's just a cool name.

**Q:** How do you pronounce DeBroglie

**A:** "duh broy". [Wikipedia has a pronounciation guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie)

**Q:** How do I...

**A:** There are many [samples](https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/DeBroglie/tree/master/samples) supplied with DeBroglie, try and find one that best matches your goal. I plan to write some articles on the best way to use the library. Contact me if you have something in mind, and I can prioritize writing it up.
